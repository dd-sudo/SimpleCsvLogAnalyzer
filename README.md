# SimpleCsvLogAnalyzer
Simple comma seperated (csv) log file analyzer.

It can plot value vs record number, and value vs another value scatter graphs.

There will be no further development on this project. I made a newer version that supports both Windows, Linux and Android. For further info: https://github.com/dd-sudo/CSV-Analyzer
